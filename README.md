# QUEERasure prototype

QUEERasure is a project that attempts to uncover the hidden queer history of Montr√©al, QC. There are multiple components to the project, including a live, theatrical component and a digital web application. The end product will involve persons downloading the app and exploring the city, uncovering new locations on the interactive map.

This iteration involves a simple proof of concept for a granting agency.
